A discord.py bot, open-source alternative to Karuta

This is an open-source discord.py alternative to Karuta Bot, which is a great bot for fun on discord groups.
Setup is pretty simple: 

-Download the ZIP and decompress it

-Go to sources and write into botdata.txt token(the bot one), password(must be a number), and member ID(with developer mode).

-Add facts, personalized answers to drops or cards with the card creator and enjoy!

For every problem, or tip, tell me, I will be happy to help/answer!
